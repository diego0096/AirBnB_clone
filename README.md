# AirBnB clone - The console

## Description

### Command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects

This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because we will use what we build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help us to:

* Put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances.
* Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.
* Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel.
* Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
* Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine.

### What’s a command interpreter

Is the part of operating system that understands and executes commands that are entered interactively by a human being or from a program. Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object
